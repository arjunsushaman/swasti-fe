# IMPORTANT: This file is used during local production builds.
# For Vercel deployments, you MUST set these in Vercel's dashboard:
# Project Settings > Environment Variables

# For now, we use dummy values that allow the build to complete with fallback data.
# When you have a production Strapi instance, update these values in Vercel.

# Strapi CMS
# Set this to your production Strapi URL when available
# For now, using a non-existent URL allows build to complete with fallback data
