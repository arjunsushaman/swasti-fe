# Production Environment Variables
#
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Vercel does NOT read this file!
# This file is only used for local production builds (npm run build).
#
# For Vercel deployments, you MUST set environment variables in:
# Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
#
# The app is designed to work WITHOUT these variables set, using fallback data.
# Only set these in Vercel when you have a production Strapi instance ready.

# Strapi CMS
# Leave empty to use fallback data (recommended until production Strapi is ready)
